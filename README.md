# Project
Built for PeddieHacks

# Inspiration
Several weeks ago we heard about a volume bar contest, in which programmers were expected to create funny volume bars that are not user friendly. Therefore, we decided to do a very similar project that involves taking screenshots instead of adjusting volumes.

# What it does
It lets the user to choose a funny method of taking screenshots, including tic-tac-toe, reversi, and mosaic. In tic-tac-toe, the user will only get the screenshot if he or she wins the tic-tac-toe game. In reversi, a reversi game is played by the user and AI. When the game ends, the user will get the screenshot, but part of the image that corresponds to the AI controlled region will be blackened. In mosaic, the user plays a number puzzle, and the finally image will be broken into 16 pieces (4 x 4) arranged as same as the arrangement of numbers in a number puzzle. The user will only get a properly arrange image if the puzzle is solved correctly.

# How I built it
The pyqt5 framework is used to build the GUI of the software. pyscreenshot is used for taking the screenshots and pillow for image processing.

# Challenges I ran into
We had no idea how to use pyqt5 before the Hackathon. Some of us are also new to python.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Despite these challenges, people without a python background quickly mastered the basics of python programming. We also got more familiar with pyqt5, pillow, and other frameworks used. Most importantly, we created a project that we are proud of.

# What I learned
Basic python programming, and how to work with others.

# What's next for Crapshot
We would like to add more interesting functions to it.

# Built With
python3, pyqt5, pyscreenshot, pillow
